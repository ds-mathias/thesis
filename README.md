# Master's Thesis
This project was sponsored industrially by ABSL-EnergySys. The aim of the project was to perform shape optimisation of ABSL's Li-Ion satellite battery structure through combining data science and engineering methods. This project report (attached) has the following report structure:
- Chapter 1: Introduction and motivation
- Chapter 2: Literature review of metamodelling and optimisation techniques
- Chapter 3: Engineering analysis software used
- Chapter 4: Principal component analysis
- Chapter 5: RBF neural network and optimisation
- Chapter 6: Baseline battery optimisation
- Chapter 7: Conclusions
